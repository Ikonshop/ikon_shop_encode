# IkonShop - A web3 platform for merchants and freelancers. 

**This repo is intended for the Encode Hackathon only.**

Pay, Tip, and Collect **anonymously** with zero fees.

IkonShop is a platform for merchants and freelancers who need to sell products and collect funds. With a GraphQL Database for products and Solana Pay for transaction execution, users are able to issue invoices, create tip jars, and collect payment at lightning speed. 

Most Tip Jar or Invoicing platforms charge their users 5% of the transaction as a fee. By leveraging both the speed and low-gas fees on the Solana Blockchain, IkonShop is able to provide a seamless way for anyone to collect funds or tips directly to their wallet with out the platform taking a cut.
